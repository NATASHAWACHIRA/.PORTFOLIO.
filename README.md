Up to this point, there are by far no contributors to the making and design of this website. Therefore marking my first website during my course program at Moringa School on the 4th of June 2021.

## Description:
The sole purpose of making this website was to improve and familiarize myself with the programming languages.

# The technological part of My portfolio.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85103605/121560155-ecc40b80-ca1f-11eb-9548-01b62c705a15.png)

I have made use of HTML which is a programing language that enabled me to generate this project.
I incorporated CSS which aided in the design and styling of this website.
