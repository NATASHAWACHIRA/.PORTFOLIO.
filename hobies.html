    <p>In addition to that, i enjoy swimming,photography,community service and travelling.For photography my major models are flora and fauna..I enjoy mostly taking potraits of my eight year old crossbreed Doberman-Rotweiller.I find photography very interesting because it is a visual expression of thought as a "picture is worth a thousand words"</p>
